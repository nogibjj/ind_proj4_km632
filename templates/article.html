    <h1>Medium Overview</h1>

    <p>
        From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, Medium is an American online publishing platform developed by Evan Williams and launched in August 2012. It is owned by A Medium Corporation.[2] The platform is an example of social journalism, having a hybrid collection of amateur and professional people and publications, or exclusive blogs or publishers on Medium,[3] and is regularly regarded as a blog host.

    <p>
        Williams, previously co-founder of Blogger and Twitter,[4] initially developed Medium as a means to publish writings and documents longer than Twitter's 140-character (now 280-character) maximum.

    <p>
        In March 2021, Medium announced a change in its publishing strategy and business model. The change is to its mix of paid journalists working on its own publications, to be reduced, versus its support of independent writers, which will increase.
